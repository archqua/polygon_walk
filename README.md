# polygon_walk

## Description of what the game should (eventually) be like
- player is a polygon that walks around infinitely generated labyrinth
- player shoots other polygons with bullets that bounce off walls and enemies
- when enemie's edge is hit enemy n-gon becomes (n-1)-gon
- when enemie's vertex is hit enemy n-gon becomes (n-2)-gon
- when enemie's number of vertices is less than 0, it is dead
- another type of enemies is invincible circles, need to come up with ideas for those
- probably need to change some parameters of environment generation as player walks around so that would feel like location change
